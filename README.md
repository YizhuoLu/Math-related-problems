# Math-related-problems

Here I collected some good math related problems and try to understand and solve them using the best approach.

1. FindPrimesWithinNAndM: find the number of primes in the range [N, M] in which N and M are both integers and M > n.
2. Codec: find effective way to encode a longURL into a shortURL and also a decode way to restore the longURL from shortURL.
