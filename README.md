# Math-related-problems

Here I collected some good math related problems and try to understand and solve them using the best approach.

1. FindPrimesWithinNAndM: find the number of primes in the range [N, M] in which N and M are both integers and M > n.
2. Codec: find effective way to encode a longURL into a shortURL and also a decode way to restore the longURL from shortURL.
3. DIStringMatch: Return a integer array in which the layout of numbers in it satisfying the 'D' 'I' rules in the given string.
4. ProjectionAreaOf3DShapes: Return the total area of all three projections of a a solid body.
5. SelfDividingNum: Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self dividing number, including the bounds if possible.
6. ComplexNumberMultiplication: Given two complex numbers all in the form of "a+bi". Return the result of two complex numbers' multiplications.
7. SmallestRangeI: Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of new array and the minimum value of the new array.
8. SpiralMatrixIII: Return a list of coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order they were visited (in spiral way).
9. StoneGame: Two guys play a game that they in turn choose one piles of stones from either leftmost side or rightmost side. Tell if the first player (choose initially) could win or not.
10. BinaryGap: find and return the longest distance between two consecutive 1's in the binary representation of a given integer.
